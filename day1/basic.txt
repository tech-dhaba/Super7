since computer understand binary we need to convert the c code to binary

steps of compilation in c
1. preprocessing : elimination of macros (#, header files) .c => .i/.p  -E
2. compilation : convert the HLL to assembly language .i/.p => .s       -s
3. assembler : convert the assembly file to binary .s => .o/.obj        -c
4. linking : combine various piece of code together:		     	-o
	4.1 static linking
	4.2 dynamic linking
